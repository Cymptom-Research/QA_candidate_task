This section is aimed to test your ability to write a simple test suit for a simple python code.
The runner you will need for running these test is pytest.

### Setup
* install python (we use version 3.7)
* install requirements file `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Task

1) Take a look at the calculator class in `calc.py`. Now look at the test for that class in `test_calc.py`.
look at the test file there, can you fill in the purpose of the last two tests?
2) Now try to run the test with pytest. What happened? Can you fix the test so it will pass?
3) can you add tests for the rest of the calculator functions?
5) Take a look at counter function in `counter.py`.
What does it do? can you update the docstring for that function to have the correct explanation?
6) Take a look at `test_counter.py`. Can you add a few tests for `counter.py` there?
